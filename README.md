# prediction-of-website-traffic-and-demand-for-inventory-optimization-using-ML
This project enhances inventory management by combining website traffic and demand forecasting using SARIMA and SARIMAX models. It involves data collection, preprocessing, and model development. Applying these forecasts helps efficiently manage stock levels, improving accuracy and reducing costs by aligning inventory with predicted demand.
Prediction of Website Traffic and Demand for Inventory Optimization Using ML

## Introduction
This project aims to optimize inventory levels by integrating website traffic forecasting with demand forecasting using advanced machine learning techniques. By predicting future visitor volumes and product demand, businesses can balance stock levels, meet customer needs, and reduce inventory costs.

## Objectives
1. Implement Website Traffic Forecasting using the SARIMA model to predict daily and seasonal variations in website traffic.
2. Predict the quantity and pattern of customer orders using the SARIMAX model.
3. Optimize inventory levels by integrating traffic and demand forecasts, ensuring sufficient stock without overstocking.

## Methodology
The project involves collecting historical sales and website traffic data, then preprocessing this data to handle missing values and outliers. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is conducted to identify trends and correlations. SARIMA and SARIMAX models are developed for forecasting, and their performance is evaluated using metrics like MAE and RMSE. Finally, the forecasted demands are used to optimize inventory levels.

## Implementation
1. Data Ingestion: Collect and import historical sales and website traffic data.
2. Data Cleaning: Preprocess the data to handle missing values and outliers.
3. Trend Analysis: Conduct EDA to identify trends, seasonal patterns, and correlations. Run ```preprocessing.py```
4. Model Training: Develop and train SARIMA and SARIMAX models for accurate forecasting. Run ```auto_arima for traffic module.py```, ```auto_arima for Demand Module.py``` to find the model parameters and then run ```websitetraffic Module.py```, ```demand module.py``` for forecasting website traffic and predicting demand respectively.
5. Inventory Management: Use forecasted demands to inform inventory optimization strategies. Run ```inventory optimization.py```.
6. Performance Evaluation: Assess model performance using MAE and RMSE. Run ```Evaluation.py```.

 ## Libraries Required
 Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Statsmodels, Matplotlib, Seaborn

## Results
The system improves forecasting accuracy and inventory management. By integrating real-time data, it adapts to changing patterns, resulting in better stock management and reduced costs. SARIMA and SARIMAX models capture seasonal variations and provide accurate forecasts.
